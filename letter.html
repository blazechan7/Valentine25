        <p class="letter-text">

            My Dearest Mervyan,<br><br>
            
            I want to share something personal with you, just for you to read. This letter is for your eyes and your heart only.
            
            When I first met you, I didn't believe love was possible for me. I couldn't trust anyone, and I didn't trust myself either. I had walls built up, and I couldn't imagine giving love or receiving it. But you came into my life, and even though I wasn't ready, you stayed. You didn't give up on me, even when I found it hard to trust.<br><br>
            
            Now, five months into our relationship, I look back on everything we've shared. But it's not just the 5 months that matter—it's the 3 months before that when we were getting to know each other, learning about each other. Every month, we've learned so much about each other. And even though we'll keep learning, I feel like we've learned the most in these months.
            
            I know we'll change as time goes on, but I'm sure that the love we share and our dreams for the future will only grow stronger. We're building something special—a place where we feel safe and supported, where we can share both happy moments and difficult ones.<br><br>
            
            You've been my safe haven, the one constant in my life when everything felt uncertain. You've shown me what it truly means to be loved and understood, to have someone who sees me for all that I am and accepts me, flaws and all. Your patience is what's kept us strong. I know that sometimes I can be difficult to understand, or I push away. But in those moments, you've always been patient with me, always held space for me to grow.
            
            For that, and for everything you do, I'm grateful. You are not just my partner, you are the one who has made me believe in love again. The one I can trust in ease, and one who accepts my obsession with Wuthering Wives.<br><br>
            
            So, with all my love, and with all the sincerity I can offer, I ask you again, will you be my Valentine?<br>
            
            I love you very muchies.<br><br>
            
            Your Otter Half,<br>
            Blaze</p>
